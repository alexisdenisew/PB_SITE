<h2 id = "states">WHAT HAPPENED?</h2>

 <p id = "callInfo">
        According to Chief Tim Gannon of the Brooklyn Center Police Department, officers pulled Mr. Wright over on Sunday afternoon for a traffic violation related to expired registration tags. Officers then discovered that he had a warrant for his arrest. As the police tried to detain Mr. Wright, he stepped back into his car, prompting a brief struggle with officers, Chief Gannon said. In graphic body camera footage shown to reporters on Monday, one officer can be seen pointing a handgun at him and shouting “Taser.” After the car pulls away, the officer yells an obscenity and says, “I just shot him” to two other officers, according to the video. The car traveled several blocks and struck another vehicle. The police and medical workers pronounced Mr. Wright dead at the scene. “It is my belief that the officer had the intention to deploy their Taser but instead shot Mr. Wright with a single bullet,” Chief Gannon said. The officer who shot Mr. Wright was identified on Monday evening as Kim Potter, a 26-year veteran of the department. Officials said she had been placed on administrative leave. [As reported by NYT]

      <p id = "callInfo">Daunte Wright, who had a 2-year-old son, dropped out of high school about two years ago because of a learning disability, his father said. Since then, he worked in retail and fast-food restaurants to support his son. He planned to go back to school to get his GED. “He was a great kid,” Aubrey Wright said. “He was a normal kid. He was never in serious trouble. He enjoyed spending time with his 2-year-old son. He loved his son.” Isaiah Caldwell, 22, said in high school, he was close friends with Daunte’s sister and that they all used to go to the Boys & Girls Club in West St. Paul. He described Daunte as a “good guy” who “had a lot of love for his family.” “He didn’t deserve that,” Caldwell said. “It’s not right.” [Reported by the Washington Post]</p>

They should all be fired, with their pensions revoked, and should be charged and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. In addition, I demand that Mayor Mike Elliott and the Brooklyn Center City Council address the excessive use of force by the Brooklyn Center Police Department, and that they provide more support for community efforts and organizations that work to prevent police brutality and violence. Daunte Wright was an innocent young man. He was just 20 years old. He was a father. He should be alive. He would be alive today if not for the negligent racist actions and gross abuse of power exhibited by the Brooklyn Center Police Department and its officers. All officers involved must face consequences for this murder in order to provide his family with justice and to deter law enforcement from committing racist and brutal acts of violence against communities of color."
