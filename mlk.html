      <p id = "mainP">"I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate [...] who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season." Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.‚Äù - MLK</p>
