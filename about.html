    <p id = "regText" class="bg">In the summer of 2020, as Alexis Williams witnessed the nationwide surge of Black Lives Matter protests, she was eager to make a meaningful contribution but unsure of how to do so from her living room. Armed with the belief that coding is a powerful problem-solving tool, she decided to take action. This led to the creation of PB-Resources, initially named Police Brutality Resources, in honor of George Floyd and all those disproportionately affected by police brutality and white supremacy.</p>
    <p id = "regText" class="bg">PB Resources began as a central hub for social justice tools, with a primary mission of advocating for the Black community while recognizing the importance of intersectionality with other marginalized groups, including people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and women, to collectively pursue liberation.</p>
    <p id = "regText" class="bg">Today, PB Resources serves as a comprehensive platform offering resources to facilitate engagement in political activism across various issues. It emphasizes the strength of intersectionality and strives to empower individuals, regardless of their level of experience in political engagement, with user-friendly automated tools for self-starting activism.</p>
    <p id = "regText" class="bg">The PB Resources community is dedicated to supporting individuals, brands, and organizations in integrating social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion into their core missions. It provides easily accessible knowledge, actionable items, and shareable content that align with progressive values.</p>
