As a member of the Barnard community, I am appalled by the failure of the administration to uphold the values of fairness, justice, and academic freedom.\n\nIt is unacceptable that our peers, primarily women of color, are being subjected to such harsh treatment, including harassment, surveillance, and unjust punishment. This behavior is antithetical to the principles of a liberal arts institution, and it tarnishes the reputation of our college. Your actions are to blame and your silence is repugnant.\n\n
I want to make it clear that I stand in solidarity with those who have been unfairly targeted, and I refuse to remain silent in the face of such injustice. I will not hesitate to voice my concerns to prospective students and donors, and I will actively discourage anyone from considering Barnard until these wrongful suspensions are revoked and all disciplinary actions dropped.\n\n
Barnard was once my dream college, but now it has become a nightmare.\n\n`;

On April 22nd, during and after the NYPD sweep of the Gaza encampment, the NYPD brutalized multiple students and community members. The police utilized pepper spray and physically attacked protestors. I am calling on NYU to address the danger inflicted by bringing the NYPD onto campus. Lastly, I am highly concerned about the endangerment to students in the closure of NYU buildings following the protests. Students were barred from entering their housing and placed in unsafe circumstances. NYU did the opposite of protecting student safety tonight, and I am ashamed of the admin at this university.\n\n`;
