<p id ="nameBlurb">
In today’s world, AI systems are used to decide who gets hired, the quality of medical treatment we receive, and whether we become a suspect in a police investigation. While these tools show great promise, they can also harm vulnerable and marginalized people, and threaten civil rights. Unchecked, unregulated and, at times, unwanted, AI systems can amplify racism, sexism, ableism, and other forms of discrimination. The Algorithmic Justice League’s mission is to raise awareness about the impacts of AI, equip advocates with empirical research, build the voice and choice of the most impacted communities, and galvanize researchers, policy makers, and industry practitioners to mitigate AI harms and biases. We’re building a movement to shift the AI ecosystem towards equitable and accountable AI.

<p id ="nameBlurb">
Since inception, the organization has been at the forefront of women’s health issues, through comprehensive public education initiatives that promote overall wellness of Black women. In 1990, BWHI opened a public education and policy office in Washington, D.C., the seat of policy and advocacy for reproductive rights. But, it was not until 1995 that the board realized the opportunity to become better positioned to address the massive challenges of racial and gender-based health disparities affecting
Black women. A decision was made to establish a national presence in the nation’s capital and relocate our national headquarters to Washington, D.C. With a broadened structure of national and local affiliated organizations and a change in name to the Black Women’s Health Imperative in 2002, the Imperative instituted aggressive national programs in health policy, education, research, knowledge and leadership development and communications to save and extend the lives of Black women. Presently, the organization continues to be dedicated to promoting physical, mental and spiritual health and well-being for the nation’s 19.5 million African American women and girls.

<p id ="nameBlurb">
The Dream Defenders was founded in April 2012 after the tragic killing of 17-year old Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. That Spring, young Black, Latinx, and Arab youth marched from Daytona Beach Florida to Sanford Florida where Trayvon Martin was killed. With that fire in their bellies, they then went back to their communities and campuses to organize. One year later, after George Zimmerman was acquitted, the Dream Defenders occupied the Florida State Capitol for 30 nights and 31 days, demanding a repeal of the Stand Your Ground law. Although we didn’t get the law changed, we knew we had done something equally important – we had built the groundwork for a movement that would spark thousands of young people in Florida and across the country to take action. We all went back to our communities across the state ready to continue the work. Today, the Dream Defenders is organizing Black and Brown youth to build power in our communities to advance a new vision we have for the state. Our agenda is called the Freedom Papers. Through it, we are advancing our vision of safety and security –  away from prisons, deportation, and war – and towards healthcare, housing, jobs and movement for all.

<a id= "namePlaqueLink" href = "https://mothersagainstpolicebrutality.org/2020-about/" target = "_blank">25. Mothers Against Police Brutality </a>
<p id ="nameBlurb">
Mothers Against Police Brutality (MAPB) is the voice for justice for victims of police brutality and deadly force. We are multi-racial, multi-ethnic coalition uniting mothers nationwide to fight for civil rights, police accountability, and policy reform. MAPB formed to unite mothers who have lost their children to police violence. Every year families lose children and other loved ones to police killings. An alarmingly disproportionate number of African American and Hispanic men killed by policemen are unarmed. In virtually every case, officers that kill unarmed Black and Brown men are never charged with a crime. We must summon the courage to challenge existing laws and practices that leave our families vulnerable to police brutality and official murder. We must summon the courage to challenge the existing investigations by district attorneys and county prosecutors that result in no indictments, no trials, and no accountability for officers involved in brutalizing and killing civilians. We must summon the courage to challenge our Congressional representatives to recognize police brutality as a gross violation of civil rights and to intervene legislatively as Congress has done in the past, with the enactment of the 1964 Civil Rights and 1965 Voting Rights Acts.  We must summon the courage to challenge the President and the Justice Department to intervene in communities where police departments show a pattern of brutality toward citizens; to investigate citizen complaints against local law enforcement agencies; and to stop providing advanced military weapons and equipment that are totally inappropriate for local peace officers. We must re-design the training and ongoing review of police officers. Officers involved in the use of excessive and deadly force typically show a pattern of abusive behavior and typically have received multiple citizen complaints prior to a major incident. Applicants to police academy need to be screened more rigorously to exclude those with psychological problems or social attitudes (i.e., racial prejudice) that will cause problems in the everyday stresses of police work. Only when there is trust between local police and citizens can we restore the social contract, protect the rights of the people, and work together to prevent and solve crime in our communities.

The Black AIDS Institute (BAI) is dedicated to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Black community. BAI is the only uniquely and unapologetically Black HIV think and do tank in America. We believe in complete freedom for Black people by eradicating systematic oppression so that we can live long, healthy lives. Our decisions, responses, programming, and messaging are informed by our roots, and by our core values of Black Empowerment, Equity, Impact, Self-Determination, and Integrity. BAI was founded by a Black, gay man living with HIV, a Black, gay doctor, and a Black, lesbian doctor. They established BAI in 1999 to mobilize and educate Black Americans about HIV/AIDS treatment and care. They envisioned an organization that directly challenged the systems of oppression that marginalize Black health and that also developed culturally specific programming to address the unique needs of Black people. With a foundation in advocacy and policy work, BAI works towards improving the health and wellness of Black people through research, community efforts, and clinical work. Recognizing that health justice is a racial and social justice issue, BAI is deeply committed to exposing the systems and roots of oppression that marginalize Black people and exacerbate our health burden. We are revolutionizing the HIV response by centering Black experiences and perspectives to ensure that Black people can live their fullest, healthiest lives with dignity, care, and respect. We see a world where all Black people are free and flourishing without HIV and AIDS, free of stigma and shame, where Black health and well-being are paramount.

<a id= "namePlaqueLink" href = "https://www.blackwomensblueprint.org/about" target = "_blank">27. Black Women’s Blueprint </a>
<p id ="nameBlurb">
We work to place Black women and girls’ lives, as well as their particular struggles, squarely within the context of the larger racial justice concerns of Black communities. We began meeting in sister circles in 2008 in living rooms, backyards and around kitchen tables, where we grappled with the state of Black women in the U.S. across ethnicity/nationality, class, sexual orientation, identity, etc. Our main focus was the 2008 Democratic Primaries. While we developed our personal, critical consciousness, parallel to this process was the political and public debate around the Obama/Clinton primary elections where Black women were being asked whether we were voting our race or our gender. Both democratic candidates presented their “blueprints” for change but neither took full stock of the particular problems Black women are facing within their communities and in greater society (gender-violence, poverty, the over-criminalization of black women and girls among others). What was manifesting itself was the cultural tendency to erase Black women by conceptualizing white women as speaking on behalf of the rights of the sex and Black men as speaking on behalf of the race. Something had to be done to unearth the intersections of race and gender in our own lives as Black women. Black women needed to offer their own voice, their own “blueprint” for change that equally reflected and benefited us, thus Black Women’s Blueprint was formed. What makes BWB unique is our specific focus on Black women and our departure from the rubric of “women of color” which we find also often supports racial hierarchies and doesn’t fully allow for Black women to deal with the ever-present history and legacy of slavery, sexual and reproductive exploitation, and subsequent periods of holocaust.

Founded in 2013, BYP100 (Black Youth Project 100) is a member-based organization of Black youth activists creating justice and freedom for all Black people. BYP100 was, at one point, just a hashtag for the 2013 “Beyond November Movement Convening” developed through the vision and leadership of Cathy Cohen. In 2012, Dr. Cathy Cohen was working with a Black Youth Project advisory council in Chicago and was advised to hold a national convening with young Black activists from across the country. Throughout the year, Dr. Cohen worked with the National Black Justice Coalition (NBJC) to gather resources for the convening and make sure there was a strong representation from the Black queer and trans community along with artists and labor unions. In July 2013 she held the “Beyond November Movement Convening” outside of Chicago. One day during the convening, the group gathered in the main holding room to dismiss for an open mic night, but before they left, someone learned that the George Zimmerman verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin would be announced shortly. The energy in the room completely shifted, and folks sat there prepared for whatever was going to happen. After George Zimmerman was found ‘not guilty’ in the murder of Trayvon Martin, everyone in the room was outraged. Some folk cried. Some folks screamed. Some people left the room. A few folks stayed and in that moment, they decided that they had to make a decision: were they gonna do/be something or would they just hold in their anger and not put that anger into action? Hence, BYP100 was born. At the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, a second convening was held. It was through this convening that 30 members of the collective later known as “BYP100” drafted the organizational vision, mission, and core value statements. BYP100 became a national collective that emphasizes building chapters throughout the country to hone in on grassroots organizing and community mobilization on local levels.
