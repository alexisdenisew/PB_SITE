      <p id = "mainP">Well over six decades after the Supreme Court declared “separate but equal” schools to be unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education, schools remain heavily segregated by race and ethnicity. It depresses education outcomes for black students; as shown in this report, it lowers their standardized test scores, it widens performance gaps between white and black students, it reflects and bolsters segregation by economic status, with black students being more likely than white students to attend high-poverty schools, and it means that the promise of integration and equal opportunities for all black students remains an ideal rather than a reality, according to Economic Policy Institute. Learn more about how we are futher than ever from MLK's dream for students of all colors to sit side-by-side in the classroom below.</p>

          <p id = "mainP">Hello, I'm [NAME], a constituent calling from [CITY, ZIP]. I'm extremely concerned about the ongoing issue of segregated schools in our district. American schools are as segregated today as they were in the nineteen-sixties, in the years after Brown v. Board of Education. I'm calling to urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to demand bipartisan action towards an integration plan for all schools across the United States. I don't want to see these young people used as a bargaining chip, so I expect my [senator/representative] to make the integration of schools a priority on your agenda. "Separate but equal" schools were not acceptable in the 1960s, and should not be acceptable today. Please pass along my concerns to the [senator/representative]. I'd appreciate if your office could follow up with me with any news related to this issue. I can be reached at [CONTACT INFO]. Thanks so much for taking my [email/call].</p>
