    <h2 id = "marginsss">Script (provided by the ACLU)</h2>
          <p id = "mainP">Hello, I'm [NAME], a constituent calling from [CITY, ZIP]. I'm contacting you in support of ending the Department of Defense’s 1033 Program and associated transfers of all military equipment and vehicles to local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. The military surplus equipment transfer program, known as the 1033 Program, was formally established in the 1997 FY National Defense Authorization Act. Since its inception, more than $7.4 billion in surplus military equipment and goods, including armored vehicles, rifles, and aircraft, have been transferred to more than 8,000 law enforcement agencies. The program came to national attention in the aftermath of the killing of Michael Brown in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. Since then, Congressional leaders have tried to reform or end this program that has caused an increase in militarized policing particularly in communities of color. Research studies indicate that the 1033 Program is not only unsafe but ineffective as it fails to reduce crime or improve police safety. In 2015, President Obama issued Executive Order 13688 that provided necessary oversight of the program. The Executive Order has since been rescinded, which only underscores that legislative action -- not executive orders -- is critical to address the concerns with this program. Please pass along my concerns to the [senator/representative]. I'd appreciate if your office could follow up with me with any news related to this issue. I can be reached at [CONTACT INFO]. Thanks so much for taking my [email/call].</p>
