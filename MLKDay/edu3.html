      <p id = "mainP">According to the NAACP, The student debt crisis has a disproportionate impact on Black borrowers and their families. Across all racial groups, Black borrowers hold the most student loan debt despite also being consistently underserved by postsecondary institutions. Data suggest that cancellation policies beyond $50,000 would benefit all demographics, eliminate racial disparities in student debt, and boost our struggling economy. Learn more about how loans are keeping Black folks from economic prosperity below. </p>

          <p id = "mainP">Hello, I'm [NAME], a constituent calling from [CITY, ZIP]. I'm extremely concerned about the rising cost of college education and increasing amount of student debt accumulated by graduates. These loans are a financial strain especially to those who are currently struggling to make ends meet during this economic crisis. I'm calling to urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to demand bipartisan support for the cancellation of all student debt. I don't want to see these young people used as a bargaining chip, so I expect my [senator/representative] to oppose Biden's proposed 10k in debt cancellation and demand more. Our society requires a college education for any kind of job mobility, and I think graduates deserve to live their lives free of the fear that they won't be able to pay thousands of dollars worth of debt. Please pass along my concerns to the [senator/representative]. I'd appreciate if your office could follow up with me with any news related to this issue. I can be reached at [CONTACT INFO]. Thanks so much for taking my [email/call].</p>
