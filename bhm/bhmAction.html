      <p id="regText">Facebook has put its own profit margins over the safety and lives of Black people since its
        inception, and new information is critical to understanding just how thoroughly they disregard the health and
        safety of our communities. A newly-released study by the Tech Transparency Project shows how egregiously

      <p id="regText">Preterm births stemming from cervical insufficiency can often be prevented with screening, but for
        insurance companies, it's more about their bottom line than about doing what is right. All women deserve to
        receive a standard of care consistent with modern medical capabilities. However, it is impossible to separate
        the issue of race from this conversation. Black women in the U.S. are 50% more likely to have a preterm birth
        than white women.</p>

        by Algorithms
        Act (via Color of Change)</a>
      <div id="smallSpace"></div>
      <p id="regText">SCRIPT: Chair Mendelson, [Representative], my name is [Name] and I'm from [County, State]. I'm
        calling to urge the Council of the District of Columbia (DC Council) to enact the Stop Discrimination by
        Algorithms Act. Algorithms are automated systems that solve puzzles and perform functions. However, these
        algorithms are far from neutral and can replicate the bias we see in human decision making. For example,
        algorithms using housing data will repeat discriminatory patterns resulting from redlining policies. We need
        regulations to prevent algorithms from bringing long outlawed discrimination into the future. The Stop
        Discrimination by Algorithms Act will be a landmark algorithmic accountability law. It is the first state bill
        to outlaw the use of discriminatory algorithms in important life opportunities by private actors. We call on the
        DC Council to advance this bill to markup and to pass it into law. The dangers of the tech industry evolve
        everyday, and DC residents need robust defenses as soon as possible.</p>

        NAACP)</a>
      <div id="smallSpace"></div>
      <p id="regText">SCRIPT: [Representative], my name is [Name] and I'm from [County, State]. We've waited for far too
        long for meaningful federal legislation from Congress. In the meantime, many more Black lives have been lost at
        the hands of police officers. On Jan. 26, 2023, multiple former Memphis police officers have been charged with
        the murder of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols – but true justice requires more accountability. We demand Congress take
        swift action by passing legislation on police reform to end the horrors of police brutality and reform a
        criminal justice system that fails to properly hold law enforcement officials accountable. Failure to pass
        legislation is a failure to protect the people who elected you.We specifically need to see an end to qualified
        immunity, which protects government officials from lawsuits seeking monetary damages, and we must collect data
        on police encounters that will provide transparency and safety for our communities.</p>

      <div id="smallSpace"></div>
      <p id="regText">SCRIPT: [Representative], my name is [Name] and I'm from [County, State].. As your constituent, I
        urge you to pass the EQUAL Act – a critical piece of legislation that will finally eliminate the racist
        sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine laws that exist in this country. The EQUAL Act has already
        passed in the U.S. House of Representatives with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 361 to 66. This legislation
        will end the unfair sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine – a disparity that is not based on
        science and has been shown to disproportionately harm communities of color – and ensure that people locked up
        under the unjust disparity get a second chance. </p>

        by the
        Government (via ACLU)</a>
      <div id="smallSpace"></div>
      <p id="regText">SCRIPT: My name is [Name] and I'm from [County, State]. The FBI, CBP, TSA, and other federal law
        enforcement agencies have long engaged in discriminatory and unconstitutional profiling of people of color,
        immigrants, and other marginalized communities. I'm deeply disturbed that broad loopholes in the government's
        anti-discrimination policies actually permit this discrimination. I'm asking you to close those loopholes so
        federal, state, and local law enforcement are banned from profiling us based on our race, religion, ethnicity,
        national origin, and other constitutionally-protected traits. Your departments have recognized that biased
        profiling is unjust, ineffective, and a waste of resources, but nevertheless permit it in the broad and vaguely
        defined categories of national security, intelligence-gathering, and at the border. </p>

      <div id="smallSpace"></div>
      <p id="regText">SCRIPT: [Representative], my name is [Name] and I'm from [County, State].. As your constituent, I
        urge you to support passage of the Abolition Amendment – which would end slavery and involuntary servitude in
        all its forms — including forced labor in prisons. The "exception clause" to the 13th Amendment barred slavery
        except for people who have been convicted of crimes. This loophole disproportionately encouraged the
        criminalization and re-enslavement of Black people during the Jim Crow era, gave rise to Black Codes, convict
        leasing, and chain gangs. It's harm persists today in the form of forced labor, poverty wages, and reliance on
        mass incarceration that disproportionately impacts people of color. Put simply: The "exception clause" has
        allowed for millions of incarcerated workers over the years to be exploited, underpaid, and excluded from
        workplace safety protection laws – and it has enabled human rights abuses and systemic racism to go on for
        centuries. </p>

        Elections
        (via Color of Change)</a>
      <div id="smallSpace"></div>
      <p id="regText">SCRIPT: [Representative], my name is [Name] and I'm from [County, State]. I am calling you as my
        state legislator because I believe that our country’s law enforcement shouldn’t be up for sale to the highest
        bidder. But right now, jail companies spend millions of dollars each year to influence county sheriff’s races in
        states across the country. That means these public officials are taking money from corporations that profit from
        keeping people locked up and exploiting those same people. County sheriffs make major decisions about health and
        safety for millions of incarcerated Americans -- which is why I urge you to take bold, common-sense action
        immediately to get jail contractor money out of sheriff's elections.</p>

      <a class="smallerTitle" id="namePlaqueLink" href="tel:2022243121" target="_blank">7. Reparations for Slavery</a>
      <div id="smallSpace"></div>
      <p id="regText">SCRIPT: [Representative], my name is [Name] and I'm from [County, State]. I urge you to support
        H.R. 40, which would establish a commission to examine the institution of slavery and its impact and make
        recommendations for reparations to Congress.No amount of material resources or monetary compensation can ever be
        sufficient restitution for the spiritual, mental, cultural and physical damage inflicted on African Americans
        ripped from their families and nations to labor for the enrichment of the United States. After the "abolition"
        of slavery, those emancipated suffered violent repression, oppression, exploitation and deprivation under Jim
        Crow laws and black codes in the South, as well as de facto segregation in every region of this nation.
        Reparations are not a symbolic act -- they are a real and necessary demand for justice that's gaining support
        among your fellow members of Congress and even power centers like J.P. Morgan, the Episcopal Church, and the
        city of Charleston, SC. Reparations are about respect, reconciliation, and propelling us toward a more just
        future.</p>

        Publishers Fight Back Against Efforts to White-Wash Black History (via Color of Change)</a>
      <div id="smallSpace"></div>
      <p id="regText">Black history is under attack. On March 22, the Florida legislature passed a bill that censors
        critical conversations about slavery, systemic racism, and oppression. A month later, the Florida Department of
        Education (FLDOE) rejected almost half of the math textbooks for the upcoming year, some of which featured
        ethnically diverse names in written prompts or included facts about Black mathematicians, like Dorothy Johnson
        Vaughan. While some of those math textbooks have since been reinstated, it’s clear that Florida legislators and
        school board officials are targeting textbook content and attempting to white-wash what our children learn in
        school. Back in October, Color Of Change warned textbook publishers that this could happen, but none of them
        wanted to make their commitment to teaching Black history public. Now, more than three million children could be
        robbed of the educational (and cultural) enrichment they deserve. </p>

There is too much at stake to do nothing. Again, we are asking that you: Make a public commitment to reject any future demands to erase Black history from your educational materials. Cease all support of the political groups/candidates behind laws to ban Black history, social justice, and other important topics from the classroom (where applicable).Invest in ongoing efforts to defend Black history (e.g., advertising campaigns, bookmobiles)."

        in Schools (via Color of Change)</a>
      <div id="smallSpace"></div>
      <p id="regText">On January 18th, Fl. Governor Ron DeSantis rejected the College Board’s request to approve an AP
        African American Studies (AAPS) course, baselessly claiming that it “significantly lacks educational value.” A
        first-of-its-kind pilot program, AP African American Studies would empower students with extensive knowledge
        about the contributions and lived experiences of Black people in this country. Lessons would range from those
        uplifting our legacy in literature and the arts to lessons about how our activism has shaped this country’s
        laws, institutions, and democracy. Not only does AP African American Studies put Black history front and center,
        but it also creates pathways for Black students to build stronger college applications and even earn university
        credit.</p>

          info = "I am appalled by the decision of your office and the Department of Education under Manny Diaz Jr., to deny access to Florida high school students to an optional Advanced Placement (AP) course in African American Studies. We strongly urge you to reverse this decision after considering the following: African American history and culture are an essential part of the American story, as are US History, European History, World History and numerous Language and Culture courses currently offered as AP courses in Florida high schools. It is critical that students have access to a comprehensive and accurate education on African American Studies. As opposed to “lacking educational value”, AP African American Studies was developed, written and vetted by at least 34 experts in the field of education, over a period of 10 years. It is an evidence-based introduction to African American studies. According to Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., professor and director of the Hutchins Center for African African American Research at Harvard University, “AP African American Studies is not CRT. It's not the 1619 Project. It is a mainstream, rigorously vetted, academic approach to a vibrant field of study, one half a century old in the American academy, and much older, of course, in historically Black colleges and universities.” Instead of AP African American Studies “robbing [Florida's] children of their innocence”, the National Education Association (NEA) states that ethnic studies “…help foster cross-cultural understanding among both students of color and white students and aids students in valuing their own cultural identity while appreciating the differences around them.” A 2021 study by Stanford University found that 9th grade students who took an ethnic studies course increased their overall engagement in school, improved attendance, and increased the probability of graduating and the likelihood of enrolling in college.The topics your office states as reasons for denying this course are but a fraction of the enormous scope of issues discussed in this course. Intersectionality, or the compounding effects of discrimination on a person with 2 or more protected-class statuses, is fact, not indoctrination. That Black LGBTQ people exist and suffer discrimination is fact, not indoctrination. That some Black activists have espoused not-capitalist views is fact, not indoctrination. We believe that nothing in this excellent curriculum runs “contrary to law.” Governor, we call on you to take immediate action to ensure that all high school students in Florida have access to an optional African American Studies course. You say “Florida must always be a great place to raise a family – we will enact more family-friendly policies to make it easier to raise children and we will defend our children against those who seek to rob them of their innocence.” Please do not let this continue to mean “White families” and “White children”. Knowledge of African American culture and history gives ALL students the ability to navigate in this complex, multi-cultural world in which we live. Do not hamper their success!"

        platformed the violence to the world. For months, Color Of Change members have warned Twitch that they have not
