On a larger scale, the rights of Black Americans are being threatened. We as American citizens have the right to protest. We have the right to organize. We have the right to speak out against our government. The actions taken against Tianna are a part of a larger movement to dismantle our democracy. If you allow the police to silence her, you are an accomplice to the degradation of our civil rights as Americans. We, the community members of San Luis Obispo County, are asking that you drop the charges against Ms. Arata. Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) in this community are marching like their lives depend on it, because they do. People will continue marching for BIPOC lives as long as people in leadership fail to honor their right to equity, justice, and representation. Not until you acknowledge and address institutional racism will our community exist without people marching for their lives.

I would like to redirect money away from BPD and into social service programs that will benefit public health and our own communities, especially communities of color. The recently passed budget for 2020 suggests that the largest fraction of the city’s budget should go to policing ($92,775,797), which is over 30% larger than even the second largest allocation of funds, fire ($67,814,889). Birmingham is planning to spend $19,959,925 on Education, Transportation, Housing for Mentally Ill, Youth Programs, City Owned Arts/Recreation Centers, Emergency Medical System, and Social Services. Birmingham is planning to spend 4.65 times more on the police than on social programs to better the future of this city. This planned spending is not consistent with the stated values of the city: Safe, Secure, and Sustainable Communities; Healthy, Thriving, and Diverse Neighborhoods; High-Performing 21st Century Education and Workforce Development Systems; etc. If this is truly representative of the council’s thoughts on how funds should be allocated in a city in which over 1,000 of my neighbors (Birmingham + Jefferson County) are currently experiencing homelessness and in which nearly 59,000 of my neighbors (downtown Birmingham) are impoverished and at risk of becoming homeless, I am ashamed to call Birmingham my home and I am ashamed to call you my elected officials. 'Crime' is not random. 'Crime' usually happens when someone has been unable to meet their basic needs. More jobs, more educational opportunities, more arts programs, more community centers, more mental health resources, as well as more of a say in how our own communities function, have proven to be much more effective at promoting community safety than policing. This is a long transition process but change starts with reallocating this funding! We don't need a militarized police force. We need to create a space in which more mental health service providers, social workers, victim/survivor advocates, religious leaders, neighbors, and friends - all of the people who really make up our community - can look out for one another.

I believe that changes will begin by defunding law enforcement and investing in community programs and infrastructure. Millions of dollars every year have been funneled toward law enforcement and mass incarceration systems that are harming our communities more than helping them. Benton County’s total budget for 2019 was roughly $80 million. Almost 41 percent of that budget was spent on law enforcement activities, while less than 2 percent was allocated to environmental services, building safety, emergency services, child support, drug control, veteran services, & public safety services combined. The funds that Benton County has budgeted for law enforcement and incarceration should be redirected into COVID-19 relief, affordable housing, education, healthcare, community centers, addiction treatment, and community-led organizations. While Benton County has been spending extraordinary amounts on policing, there have not seen sufficient improvements to safety, homelessness, mental health, or affordability in our towns. Benton County would be better served by dedicating resources to programs that are more effective at promoting safety and social equity than policing and incarceration. The infrastructure of public spaces such as community gardens and parks has always been part of what makes Northwest Arkansas such a beautiful community, and that should not be restricted only to the wealthy areas of town. We can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have the courage to change. Can I count on you to consider an alternative budget that puts a focus on social services rather than police?"

I urge you to pressure the City Manager’s Office towards an ethical and equal reallocation of the city’s expenditures, away from LRPD, and towards sectors that facilitate the dismantling of racial and class inequality. The recent approval of body cameras alone will not address the systemic racism of policing at its core. Research shows that a living wage, access to holistic health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at promoting community safety than police or prisons (Source: Popular Democracy). As such, I demand more aggressive financial support be directed to those areas. Do not forget our poor communities and communities of color who are the disproportionate targets of police violence.

They were given the power to: Investigate and provide independent reports on police use-of-force incidents and citizen complaints, Make disciplinary recommendations for individual officers to the Police chief, Recommend policy changes based on research and community feedback. When the council approved the plan, it anticipated it would cost about $3 million, but in Wednesday’s 2020-21 budget decision it only received $400,000. In 2019, The Phoenix PD received $721 million from the City of Phoenix. The current City Manager recommendation is $741 million, a $20 million increase, yet they can’t provide $3 million to OAT. Ending police brutality should be a budget priority. Justice should be a budget priority. Health and safety--which are proven to be better promoted through social programs and education than policing--should be a priority. I demand that you, as a representative of your Phoenix constituents, fully fund OAT, and redirect a meaningful portion of the Phoenix PD budget to social services, cultural programs, and education, which are backbones of any healthy community. Thank you."

Continuous budget cuts in Education slash essential after-school and enrichment programs, and large cuts in Parks and Rec over the years force a shortage of hours of recreation centers and special events. I know many of you feel strongly about racial justice and equity. Mayor Romero claims to have a commitment to the people of Tucson, and, on June 2, claimed that the police require 'systemic reform and meaningful policy change.' Your words are meaningless unless you use your power to take action on that. Individual solutions will not fix systemic problems.

I demand of the county supervisors to prove their love and dedication to the people of their county and reallocate funds to directly benefit those in need. It is absolutely absurd that the Sheriff’s budget exceeds $3,500,000,000. That is money that could be used to improve our communities, rather than funding an organization with an extremely racist past and present. Defunding the police and restructuring the budget is an absolute necessity now more than ever. There are 58,936 DOCUMENTED houseless people in Los Angeles CITY alone. There are healthcare workers without proper equipment. More than 30% of Los Angeles County residents have filed for unemployment. Our transportation infrastructure continues to be one of the most prominent examples of INSUFFICIENT PUBLIC SPENDING, and we all know that with even a fraction of the money given to the Sheriff’s Office we could completely transform our transportation system and social programs. However, we are not asking for a fractional cut. We demand large spending cuts to the Sheriff’s Office. In recent years, the most prominent news about the LA County Sheriff’s Office has been word of The Banditos, a gang of police officers who find themselves above the law and have a DECADES-LONG well-documented history of both police brutality and silencing any “good police officers” who try to challenge them. THIS is not what our county represents. It is time to recognize the change occurring nationwide, and to DEFUND THE LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. While The Sheriff’s Department has more funding than it knows what to do with, there are communities who desperately need funding and every day they don't receive it their quality of life worsens. Thousands have died who did not need to. You have the ability to change this, so do it. I implore you to take steps to defund a militarized force of organized state violence with a WELL-DOCUMENTED HISTORY of brutality and state-sanctioned extrajudicial murder. I DEMAND that you defund the LA County Sheriff’s Office. It is imperative to note that the sheriff’s department and LA county police do not keep ALL of us safe. They have historically targeted Black people, people of color, and queer people within our own communities.

That's untenable, especially coming from a city that prides itself in promoting equity and being on the progressive edge of history. In light of these statistics, and in the wake of the Minneapolis City Council pledging to completely reimagine policing in their city, I strongly support the Boulder Police Department being defunded immediately, and that the money go towards creating affordable housing within city limits.

What we need are more mental health professionals, more youth counselors, and more resources for homeless folks and those struggling to make ends meet. Investing so much money in the police shows a priority for maintaining a inequitable status quo, not a commitment toward community enhancement and racial justice.

Hartford’s needs must be addressed by the provision of care, and not the threat of violence. We must invest in public services that build towards “a free and fair society” rather than an armed force that endangers us. Our city faces racial inequalities, borne from historical injustice and brought into sharp relief by the COVID-19 epidemic, that can’t be solved by policing. Hartford is intensely segregated, and deals with the issues of extreme income inequality between Hartford City, and suburbs like West Hartford. Members of our community live in tight quarters and on lean budgets–this before a pandemic stole three months of wages, and counting. Thousands of us are becoming food-insecure and are at risk of eviction as soon as the ban is lifted. Essential educators are living on starvation pay while repeated and overwhelming community demands to right this glaring injustice are ignored. Hartford City spends over half of its Public Safety budget on Police, when that money could be better reallocated toward improving addiction and mental health services, providing permanent housing for our unhoused neighbors, and improving city infrastructure. Now especially, the City Council can take a stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing and investing in Black and Brown communities–starting with cutting the least transparent and most harmful parts of the Hartford Police Department budget. Racist police violence doesn’t just happen in other cities–it happens here in Hartford too. We see it in the disproportionate imprisonment of Black people, and in the racialized inequality that is prevalent in Hartford. The City Council must stop investing in targeted criminalization and surveillance, and fund what Black and Brown communities need to be safe and healthy:\ COVID19 relief, housing, healthcare, treatment, healing, cooperative businesses, community centers, community-led organizations and projects."

        name = "To the DC council in charge of the allocation of funds to the Metropolitan Police Department and its respective members,"
        info = "This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for rapid and meaningful change with regard to police behavior, an end to racism and anti-Blackness, and immediate reform in how Black people are treated in America. Our city has been at the forefront of much of this action. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that there will be a council meeting in June that will discuss the budget for the Metropolitan Police Department. I am emailing today to ask the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety to vote against the Mayor’s proposed budget increase for the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). I am calling attention to the fact that this increase is occurring as the budgets for the Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement and the Office of Victim Services and Justice Grants are being reduced. DC's incarcerated population is one of the most disproportionately Black in the US (at 89%), even though Black people only comprise 46% of the DC population. Despite our liberal reputation and city motto of "Justice for All", if DC were a state, it would have the highest incarceration rate in the country. In 2019, the Washington Post reported that most stops by MPD were made of Black Washingtonians, and we are renowned across the country for the revenue we extract from these stops ($1 billion last year alone in traffic stops). In addition, the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs released a report on the disparities in fare evasion enforcement toward Black residents on public transportation. Findings demonstrated that the District disproportionately stops and incarcerates Black residents from the city's poorest wards. The systems flaws are wide open for all to see, and can only be solved with a recognition that the criminalization of poverty must end. The MPD is at the center of this local crisis. While employing historically racist tactics to incite fear in Black communities, MPD has been in steady collaboration with ICE officials, standing against the city’s vows to be a sanctuary for immigrant communities. In addition to their continuation of the unconstitutional stop and frisk policies, often just by other names (protective pat-downs, and jump-outs), MPD often downplays this data in testimony to the DC Council. Additionally, the steady increase to the MPD budget despite the twenty percent uptick in from 2017-2018 in use of force cannot be ignored. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only revealed stark disparities in housing, healthcare, COVID-19 testing, and access to food, but has exacerbated the underlying conditions that leave thousands of low-income residents more vulnerable to this deadly infectious disease. This is where we should be focusing our efforts and funding. It is unconscionable that in the midst of a health pandemic that is overwhelmingly killing Black people – as 76% of COVID deaths are of Black DC residents – that Mayor Bowser would propose increasing an already bloated police budget to almost $580 million, while at the same time divesting from critical public health resources like violence prevention and interruption, mental healthcare, trauma and victims services, and reentry services. The fact that we have ample funds for riot shields and tear gas but at one point questioned the adequacy of our supply of hospital beds and PPE is more than poor leadership and mismanagement of resources — it is a glaring and total moral failure. The $18.5 million increase to MPD, should be allocated elsewhere when considered within the context of this ongoing pandemic and the $700 million dollar city budget deficit. This funding would be better allocated towards supporting DC Public Schools and funding community health initiatives (such as the Dept. of Health, Dept. of Health Care Finance, and the Dept. of Behavioral Health). We must ask ourselves as a city that claims "Justice for All" as our motto — what kind of justice are we referring to? Economic Justice? Racial Justice? Social Justice? Or is the grand sum of our capacity for justice to offload problems we are unwilling to deal with at their source onto an agency whose main tools will, at the end of the day, always be those of violence and coercion? The current status-quo cannot be maintained, and I urge you to listen to community leaders and members of the DC chapter of Black Lives Matter as well as Stop Police Terror Project DC and defund the Metropolitan Police Department. The resources are in desperate need elsewhere. Do not abandon the people you were elected to serve."

Racist police violence doesn’t just happen in other cities - it happens in Jacksonville too. Our community has a long history of racist policy in housing and school segregation. Black citizens have been subjected to centuries of economic and social exclusion in Jacksonville. Our history still causes inequality today, and these issues must become financial priorities in order to heal from our history. I write to request changes to be made to the way our city allocates its funds. I urge you to restructure the City of Jacksonville’s budget ethically. Commit to our city’s Black communities and combat an over-investment in their criminalization and discrimination. The City Council can take a stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing and instead investing in Black communities. Provide relief to those in our community that are victimized by the structural racism that Jacksonville was built upon, and that JSO enforces. Deprioritize JSO’s budget and reallocate funds towards the following social services: Community Development, Affordable Housing Programs, Eviction Diversions, COVID Relief and Healthcare, Substance Abuse Treatment Services, Education, Childcare, Transportation, Jobs, and Parks & Recreation. All of these sectors will facilitate the dismantling of racial inequality and will support social justice. This action will reflect the decades of research showing that social programs, education, and a living wage are more successful at promoting the safety of a city than policing or prisons. Ending police brutality and bringing justice to our city should be a budget priority. Overpoliced communities are not safe communities. Thriving communities are safe communities, and communities thrive when they are well-resourced. JSO has been a waste of our resources. Last year, the JSO budget was $478,386,277. This means JSO was our single largest expense; more costly than all other city departments combined! JSO holds responsibility over community issues that they are fundamentally unable to address. We have seen mounting evidence that police departments are ineffective institutions that marginalize minority communities and put citizens at risk of injury and death. Our city needs EMTs, social workers, and other social service providers to respond to the majority of current police business, including health and wellness checks, domestic/sexual violence situations, and basic documentation around break-ins, vandalism, and wrecks. Usually, when police are dispatched, rather than qualified medical, psychiatric, and social workers, the effect is to bring violence where none previously existed. Jacksonville’s needs must be addressed by the provision of care, not the threat of violence. JSO offers “unlimited overtime pay for all” through Operation Safe and Sound, which oftentimes is paid out to officers responsible for harassing minorities. We don’t need a militarized police force. Divest from offensive weapons. Offensive weapons are known to escalate violence. If you want to promote community safety, dedicate yourselves fully to ending poverty– don’t give the police force another $478 million+ to spend on riot gear, grenades, and weapons to use against your own city. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve–and actively harms–our community, and come together to reimagine the role of policing. Do not forget our communities of color who are disproportionate targets of police violence. Our police department is, quite frankly, upholding policies and practices that allow white supremacy to take Black lives every single day. As the City Council, it is your duty to represent your constituents. I am urging you to completely revise the budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Mayor Curry, can I count on you to pass an alternative budget that puts a focus on social services?"

        info = "Last May, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw requested a 6% hike in funding for his department, proposing an annual budget of $703 million for 2020 with $75 million set aside for replacing vehicles in the next five years. According to the Palm Beach County Fiscal Year 2020 Budget, the Sheriff’s Office was appropriated more than $725.8 million—an 8% increase from 2019. Combined with federal and municipal-level funding, the full financial cost of policing in our area dramatically dwarfs support for resources that would enrich and protect Florida communities: youth programs, food security, mental health and wellness, free public transport, affordable housing, universal childcare, substance abuse prevention and treatment, and more. For example, the 2020 budget awarded $813,582 to the Office of Equal Opportunity, which has a staff of 12 working on disability access, equal employment, and fair housing. The Criminal Justice Commission received just $750,417 from the county to support 11 staff members working to reduce pretrial detentions, incarceration rates, and racial disparities. Speaking of disparities, the Sheriff’s Office averaged more than twice the amount of funding for each of its 4,289 positions. I urge you to reimagine the way the justice system works in Palm Beach County. This means investing in our community’s long-term health and prosperity and, in doing so, decreasing the demand for such an expensive police force in the first place. Until Palm Beach County does this, we are failing to serve communities of color and actively upholding a system of white supremacy. Your mission statement is “to drive a continuous improvement culture of excellence that achieves a measurably high level of public satisfaction” in Palm Beach County. For such satisfaction to be achieved, you should adopt a budget that prioritizes community well-being through education, health care, and social services while redirecting funding away from police and incarceration. As one of your constituents, I’m asking you to take immediate, concrete action on this issue. I will be sure to tell my friends, family, and neighbors about your response."

This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for a rapid and meaningful reconsideration of the role of policing in communities as well as an end to racism and anti-Blackness in America. Our city has been at the forefront of much of this action. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that the budget for 2021 is being decided as these protests continue. The proposed FY21 proposed city budget increases the budget for police. Upon reviewing this budget, I have noticed that 38.85% of the general fund is dedicated to our police departments. This amounts to a staggering $116,367,838 for the police. We also are planning to add another 25 full-time police officers, expanding our police force. I demand that the City Council begin meaningfully defunding the St. Petersburg Police Department and re-allocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, job creation, affordable housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of St. Petersburg residents. History has shown that police 'reform' is not enough.

        topic = "Letter to Boise Mayor and City Council"
        name = "Dear this name,"
        info = "Following yet another string of highly-publicized murders of Black Americans by law enforcement, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for a rapid and meaningful reconsideration of the role of policing in communities as a significant step in dismantling systems that do not serve, and in fact actively harm, Black Americans and Americans of color. This moment is an opportunity to rethink public safety in Boise and reinvest in services that more effectively benefit our residents now and in the long-term. We have the opportunity to creatively put into place changes that can transform our community for the better and show that Boise really is one of the most 'liveable cities in America' - for all Boiseans, present and future. Although Boise is not at the forefront of these protests, it is not exempt from the racism and violence of the police system. I am asking that you consider reallocating significant funds from the BPD budget to fund systems and programs that serve our community more effectively. We need more affordable housing, safety nets for those at risk of eviction, food-access supports for those who need them, behavioral health crisis responders that are trained appropriately to de-escalate and provide access to holistic services, and social workers that can serve those that have experienced domestic violence and abuse. Our community needs healing - not punishment because of the lack of resources and supports being offered. According to the City of Boise's budget, nearly 30%, or $70,006,493, is allocated to the Boise Police Department. The single LARGEST budget category in the city budget. Only .018% of this policing budget is allocated toward mental health services coordination in policing, and .032% of this budget is allocated toward the crisis negotiation team. In the 2019 annual city budget report, BPD says that 'Law enforcement faces a growing threat from offenders armed with higher powered weapons, so BPD is researching and purchasing more robust safety equipment to better protect officers and citizens in active shooter situations.' However, according to the City of Boise's crime rate reports, violent crimes has been stagnating and decreasing in recent years - not increasing. Why has BPD been asking for funds to defend against 'active shooters' when this does not seem to be a substantiated threat? As of FY20, the Boise Police Department plans to use public funds to renovate multiple stations and build another. Again, it's been shown that social programs and education are far more effective than policing at promoting safe communities. What could these resources fund instead? The city's community engagement budget is just 1% of Boise's overall budget, which includes projects that support those experiencing housing insecurity and homelessness, as well as events that bring tourism revenue to Boise; yet this budget also includes funds allocated for police recruitment materials. Funds allocated to support community supports should NOT be allocated to recruiting even more police officers for the city. The city of Boise MUST reconsider how it prioritizes its budget. Boise does a disservice to all Black and brown community members by continuing to fund policing rather than actual community support systems that will lessen our dependency on police intervention. Reallocating funds will make all Boiseans safer. I demand that the Mayor's office and City Council begin meaningfully defunding the Boise Police Department and reallocate those funds to programs proven to more effectively promote a safe and equitable community: community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, and more. I demand a budget that reflects the actual needs of Boise residents. The added economic impact of COVID-19 requires a complete re-imagining of how we allocate local resources, and makes abundantly clear that we must prioritize investments in our community's health and well-being. The city of Boise can address deficits by divesting from the violence of policing and incarceration. The systems of policing and incarceration have no role in public health or safety; prisons and jails are vectors for the spread of COVID-19 and have always been antithetical to public health. Existing racial and economic disparities will only worsen in the wake of this ongoing health and economic crisis. We know that this virus is disproportionately affecting Black and brown communities, and that this disparity is caused by racist systems that affect how and when people receive care.History has shown that police 'reform' is not enough. We must take a hard look at the ways that the current system in place fails to serve – and in fact actively harms – our community, and come together to re-imagine the role of police in our city. Imagine if Boise could be on the front lines of a movement of change in our country, one that could be truly transformative? What could our city look like in 5, 10, and 20 years?"

In the 2020 budget, the City of Lawrence increased the Police Department budget another 2.5 million dollars, equating to an inordinate 33.35% of our city’s total taxpayer funded budget at over 27 million dollars. This is compared to just 1.34% of our city budget allocated to Public Health, and 10% of our budget allocated to Municipal Services & Operations.

The Lawrence Community Shelter, and vital community organizations like Just Food and the Willow Domestic Violence Center, both of whom received only 16,000 dollars combined in the 2020 budget.

I am therefore writing to demand that the Metro Council consider reapportion of general funds away from the LMPD and towards the existing Criminal Justice Commission, social services and education programs, effective at the beginning of FY21, July 1, 2020.

Through a reallocation of funds, we can promote the well-being of citizens and reduce crime by sourcing community-based solutions, allowing residents to become invested in providing recommendations for improvements in criminal justice system operations and to engage in creating solutions that best serve their communities and their needs. I also urge Metro Council to enact legislation that holds police members accountable and to overturn policies that allow police members to engage in unlawful behavior with impunity, that an elected Civilian Police Accountability Council be established with real reform powers, and that abusive or reckless officers, including the officers involved in Breonna Taylor's death, be fired and criminally charged.
